# Data Modeling Approaches

This repository demonstrates different data modeling approaches for a space rental management system, implementing the same core functionality using three distinct database paradigms.

## Overview

Each implementation showcases the strengths and trade-offs of its respective data model:

1. **[Relational Model](./Relational-Model/)**
   - Traditional SQL-based approach
   - Strong data consistency
   - Well-defined schema
   - ACID compliance

2. **[Document Model](./Document-Model/)**
   - MongoDB-based implementation
   - Flexible schema design
   - Embedded documents
   - Horizontal scalability

3. **[Graph Model](./Graph-Model/)**
   - Neo4j-based implementation
   - Relationship-focused design
   - Powerful traversal queries
   - Complex pattern matching

## Core Features

All implementations support these core features:
- User management and authentication
- Space listing and search
- Booking management
- Payment processing
- Review and rating system

## Comparison

### Relational Model
- **Best for**: Complex joins, strict data integrity
- **Strengths**: ACID compliance, standardized queries
- **Challenges**: Schema changes, horizontal scaling

### Document Model
- **Best for**: Flexible data structures, rapid development
- **Strengths**: Schema flexibility, embedded documents
- **Challenges**: Complex transactions, data redundancy

### Graph Model
- **Best for**: Connected data, relationship analysis
- **Strengths**: Relationship traversal, pattern matching
- **Challenges**: Distributed scaling, learning curve

## Use Case Recommendations

Choose the appropriate model based on your priorities:

1. **Relational Model** if you need:
   - Strong data consistency
   - Complex reporting
   - Traditional OLTP workloads

2. **Document Model** if you need:
   - Rapid development
   - Flexible schema
   - High write throughput

3. **Graph Model** if you need:
   - Complex relationships
   - Path finding
   - Pattern matching
